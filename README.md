# Omiran-App

An open source live streaming application that is developer-oriented and removes the political overhead and censorship that other streaming platforms exhibit. The application's name, "Omiran", is Yoruba for, "alternative". This application, from a user's perspective can be interpreted as an alternative; an alternative to the harshly controlled and revenue focused platforms. We will also implement a 0% deduction of streamers' subscription money; funded by either github sponsors, or ads.
