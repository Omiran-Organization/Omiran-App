# Backend Todo List

## GraphQL Service (frontend queries it)

  - [x] Go server with MySQL database transactions serving graphql
  - [] Elasticsearch support for stream/user search

## CI/CD 

   1. Dockerize application monolithically
   2. Integrate test automation and deploy automation scripts

## Database CRUD
   
   1. Create database and prerequisite tables with `backend/database-boilerplate.sql`
   2. Connect to database via go server (will probably use a `.yml` config for credentials and other necessary data)
   3. Perform Read and Write of data from both tables with successful struct scanning for programmatic use of data
